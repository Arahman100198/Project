The Titanic survival prediction is a classic machine learning problem where the goal is to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not, based on various features such as their age, gender, ticket class, and cabin location. The task involves building a model that can learn from historical data on passenger characteristics and survival outcomes, and can then make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

The Titanic dataset is a well-known example of this problem, containing information on over 800 passengers who were aboard the Titanic during its ill-fated maiden voyage in 1912. The dataset includes various features such as passenger age, gender, ticket class, cabin location, and whether they survived or not.

This problem is commonly used as a benchmark for testing and comparing different machine learning algorithms and techniques, and has been the subject of numerous research papers and competitions. The best models are typically able to achieve prediction accuracies of over 79%.
